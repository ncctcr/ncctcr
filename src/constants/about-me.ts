    title: 'My Journey into the IT Industry',
    rows: [
      'My path into the IT industry began back when I was living in Kherson. At the time, I was finishing my studies at a technical college specializing in instrumentation. I was at a crossroads: either continue developing as a radio technology specialist or try something entirely new. My brother was already working as a developer and encouraged me to build my own website. I had very little understanding of how everything worked, but to my surprise, I managed to bring my first website idea to life without much difficulty.',
      'That experience sparked my curiosity, and I went on to experiment with Java, Python, and other programming languages. I found myself genuinely enjoying the process — and more importantly, it felt natural to me. That’s when I made the decision to pursue a degree in Software Engineering.',
      'I spent four great years studying at Kherson State University. I gained a lot of foundational knowledge, but I knew it wouldn’t be enough to confidently enter the IT job market. That’s why I actively worked on personal projects in parallel with my studies.',
      'During my third year, I got my first job in tech. I still remember getting a call from my first manager during a lecture. He asked, “Hey, want to try a test task?” I said yes. It turned out to be something completely new to me, and it really made me think hard. After successfully completing it, I got my first role — and with it, my entry into the IT industry.'
